This is the initial training set of machine learning potential functions from our paper, Unified Deep Learning Network for Enhanced Accuracy in Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Bilayer Graphene, Hexagonal Boron Nitride, and Their Heterostructures, published in the Journal of Applied Physics. We will be updating all input and output files within the next one to two weeks. If you use data from our work, please remember to cite it. You can access the paper via this link: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0201698. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.
