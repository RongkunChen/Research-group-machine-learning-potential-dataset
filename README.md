# About Our Group
Our research group focuses on theoretical studies and numerical simulations of nanoscale heat conduction, investigating both normal and anomalous phonon transport. We explore the regulation of thermal energy in micro- and nanostructures, while fostering interdisciplinary collaborations with emerging fields such as materials informatics, materials science, and energy engineering. Additionally, we aim to optimize the design of thermal functional materials and devices by leveraging deep machine learning and artificial intelligence.
# About this project
This project aims to open-source the foundational dataset from our team's work in the field of machine learning potential functions. We hope this will provide a reliable resource for researchers and contribute to addressing data science challenges in this area. In the future, we will continue to release additional datasets from our work. Stay tuned for updates.
